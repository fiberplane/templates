# Contributing Templates

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and
transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Contributing a new template
- Submitting a fix
- Other ideas

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as to
accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use
[Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)).
We actively welcome your pull requests:

0. Before creating a pull request, please make sure it is in line with the
   projects' goals. If you have doubts about this, feel free to open a
   discussion first before spending time on a pull request that may get
   rejected.
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you're adding a new template, please provide a README for it, and add it
   to the overview of the example templates in the main README.
3. Be mindful of breaking changes, please discuss these first with the
   maintainers. This is mainly a concern when changing existing templates and
   their parameters.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 License and the MIT License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be
under the same [Apache License](LICENSE-APACHE) and [MIT License](LICENSE-MIT)
that cover the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a
concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/fiberplane/templates/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by
[opening a new issue](https://github.com/fiberplane/templates/issues/new)!

## Use GitHub's [discussions](https://github.com/fiberplane/templates/discussions) for other feedback

Do you want to request a new feature, or suggest another kind of change? Maybe
you have a question about how to approach something? Please
[start a new discussion](https://github.com/fiberplane/templates/discussions/new)!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great bug reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you
  tried that didn't work)

The better you help us understand your problem, the better we can help you!
